# Purpose:              Personnalize your bash prompt

# Latest user version:  bash-2.05
# ===============================================================
# displays the time, username, hostname,
# working directory, and, if
# there are background
# processes, it finds out how
# much processes there are and
# prints them. It drops the
# background process display if
# there are none. It also has
# different colors for each
# element displayed. 

# To use this bash prompt, put,
# or replace, the PS1= from the
# included text file into your
# ~/.bashrc, and add something
# like this to your
# ~/.bash_profile if it's not
# already there:
#
# if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
# source ~/.bashrc
# fi 


function jobcount {
    jobs | wc -l | tr -d " "
